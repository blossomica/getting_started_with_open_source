[![Header image saying "A simple guide to get you started"](https://github.com/blossomica/getting_started_with_open_source/blob/master/header_image.png)](https://github.com/blossomica/getting_started_with_open_source)

Here are a number of resources I feel are helpful for people who are interested to start contributing to an Open Source project.

In order to be able to contribute code to an open source project you first have to learn how to code, however there are other ways you could contribute to open source projects that do not necessarily need you to have the skill of coding. Below I have placed several options you could look into whether you are looking for ways to contribute code or other ways to contribute without needing to code.

## Introductory Reads
* [The Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd) - Brief explanation of what opensource means.

* [Open Source Licenses](http://opensource.org/licenses/) - To understand more about licenses of open source projects. 


## Finding Projects
Here are a few suggestions on approaches you can take:
* [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore/) - Search projects based on programming languages to contribute to.
* [Up for grabs](http://up-for-grabs.net/#/) - A list of projects which have curated tasks specifically for new contributors.
* [Your first PR](https://yourfirstpr.github.io/) - A place to find starter issues.
